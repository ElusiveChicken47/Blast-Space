####BLAST SPACE####

In the enigmatic universe of Blast Space, the cubes are not just resources—they are the lifeblood of the universe, coveted by all. Only the chosen few, known as Blasters, possess the rare ability to petrify and capture these precious cubes. But beware, for the timing of this petrification is crucial. Choose unwisely, and the consequences could be dire...

The game’s mechanics are deceptively simple yet thrilling. As a player, you must bide your time, waiting for the perfect moment when the maximum number of cubes are within the Blast Space. Then, with a single press of the space bar, you have just 10 seconds to seize your chance. Will you master the art of the Blaster, or will the cubes slip through your grasp? The fate of Blast Space hangs in the balance.
